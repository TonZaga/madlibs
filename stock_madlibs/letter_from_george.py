    madlib = f"Hello, my fellow {p_noun} in 2020, it's me, George Washington, the first {occupation}.  I am writing from (the) {place}, where I have been secretly living for the past {number} years. I am concerned by the {adj} state of affairs in America these days.  It seems that your politicans are more concerned with {verb_ing} one another than with listening to the {p_noun2} of the people.  When we declared our independence from (the) {place2}, we set forth a/an {adj2} path guided by the voices of the everyday {p_noun3}.  If we're going to keep {verb_ing2}, then we need to learn how to respect all {p_noun4}.  Don't get me wrong, we had {adj3} problems in my day, too.  Benjamin Franklin once called me a/an {noun} and kicked me in the {p_body}.  But at the end of the day, we were able to {verb} in harmony.  Let us find that {adj4} spirit once again, or else I'm taking my {p_body2} off of the quarter!"
